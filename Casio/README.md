Support Files for WK-3000 Keyboard

Includes:
CCMID12 - Support Drivers for old model keyboards.
WK3000/3100/3500 Manual
WK3000 MIDI Implementation

Note: Use IDES 3.0 to convert formatting to CTK file format from AC7. Will be hit or miss and require a lot of tweaking, atleast 40% wrong.
Smart Media Chips are expensive, go for the 3500 Model with Floppy Disk Support. Or buy a WK-6000s series with USB support.
